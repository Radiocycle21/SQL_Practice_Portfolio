# SQL_Practice_Portfolio
A portfolio showcasing daily SQL practice, with solutions, using a custom-built database

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains my solutions to various SQL problems I've solved for my practice. I'm using a self-built database to work on different types of business problems.

Each SQL file represents a daily practice session and includes multiple problems, with solutions and a brief explanation of the logic.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my proficiency in a wide range of SQL skills, including complex joins, data transformation, and analytical functions.

All problems are solved using the database schema and sample data provided in this repository.

I've focused on solving all the problems using MS SQL Server. However, I've added files for MySQL as well.

I'm committed to adding to this repository on a daily basis to showcase my continued learning and skill development.
